## Tahoe Joe's Famous Steakhouse Restaurants

### Our Place: A First Rate Ski Lodge

Step into a Tahoe Joe’s Famous Steakhouse restaurant, and it’s like taking a trip to Lake Tahoe. The atmosphere is reminiscent of a warm, friendly, lodge with pine log beams stretched throughout spacious ceilings and hand painted teepee lamps.  Turn of the century photos and authentic artifacts take guests back to a day gone by.  The rich glow of the roaring fire beckons you from within a stone draped fireplace.  The dining room’s alluring ambiance draws you in to bask in the relaxing atmosphere that allows you to escape from everyday life.
