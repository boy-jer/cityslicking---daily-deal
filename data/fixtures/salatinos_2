## Salatino's

In an effort to resurrect the former Gennaro's, Scott Harris (famous for Mia Francesca) offers up this slightly larger 100-seat homage. The legendary pan-fried pork chops, homemade ravioli, eggplant Parmesan and cannolis will be present, and still overseen by Mary Jo Gennaro and her family recipes. The old peephole in the door is still there, but this place is no secret.
