## Caminito Argentinian Grill

A colorful, picturesque street located in the neighborhood of La Boca, Buenos Aires, Argentina. A neighborhood built up by new immigrants, mostly from Italy (particularly from Genoa) and Spain, but also from Greece, Yugoslavia, and Turkey. They brought with them their culinary experiences, which we present to you to savor a bit of South American cuisine. A blend of Spanish and Italian cuisine with a distinct Porte√±o (name for natives of Buenos Aires) flare. Argentines not only have a penchant for pasta, but also a love affair with asado (traditional Sunday family barbecue of different cuts of beef). We hope you enjoy your South American experience at Caminito Argentinian Grill.
