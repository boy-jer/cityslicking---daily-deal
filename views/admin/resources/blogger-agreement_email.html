	<h1>Blogger Agreement</h1>
	
	<p>The CITYSLICKING blog is a place for members and other people interested in making effective communication, a human right, accessible and achievable for all to participate in the conversation. CITYSLICKING's blogging community exists to engage members in exciting opportunities in our various locales. CITYSLICKING members and invited guests will write and submit for publishing original posts, and because CITYSLICKING is open to the public, posts may be written by non-members as well. CITYSLICKING staff will maintain and monitor the blog, but the nature of the conversations reflect the members' and others' thoughts. The Blogging Guidelines below define the conduct for people writing postings on CITYSLICKING. The <a href="/policies">Terms of Use</a> of Our Website provides the overall agreement for using the CITYSLICKING website including this blog. This document is subject to change at CITYSLICKING's sole discretion.</p>
	
	<h2>Agreement</h2>
	<p>By submitting a post to CITYSLICKING, you acknowledge that you have read and are bound by this agreement, as well as any other CITYSLICKING usage agreements that may govern your conduct. Thank you for participating in the CITYSLICKING. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have questions.</p>
	
	<h2>Accountability</h2>
	<p>You are legally responsible for your commentary, whether in the form of a post, comment, or content submitted in any manner. You can be held personally liable for any commentary deemed to be defamatory, obscene (not swear words, but rather the legal definition of “obscene”), proprietary, or libelous (whether pertaining to CITYSLICKING, individuals, or any other entity). For these reasons, you should exercise caution with regards to exaggeration, colorful language, guesswork, obscenity, copyrighted materials, legal conclusions, and derogatory remarks or characterizations.  You blog or post on the blogs of others at your own risk since outside parties can pursue legal action against you (not CITYSLICKING) for such postings.</p>
	<p>You understand that all content posted to CITYSLICKING is the sole responsibility of the individual who originally posted the content. All opinions expressed by users of this site are expressed strictly in their individual capacities, and do not represent the positions, strategies or opinions of CITYSLICKING or any of its affiliated organizations.</p>
	<p>You agree that CITYSLICKING will not be liable, under any circumstances and in any way, for any errors or omissions, loss of damage of any kind incurred as a result of any content posted on this site. You agree that you must evaluate and bear all risks associated with the use of any content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such content.</p>
	
	<h2>Posting</h2>
	<p>While we believe in free speech, CITYSLICKING reserves the right in its discretion to refuse to post, edit, revise, or take down any post, comment, or content on the website.  As a general matter, you may submit content to CITYSLICKING so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, defamatory, threatening, infringing of intellectual property rights, invasive of privacy or otherwise injurious or objectionable.</p>
	<p>You may not use the CITYSLICKING name to endorse or promote any political candidate. Representation of your personal opinions as institutionally endorsed by CITYSLICKING or any of its affiliated organizations is strictly prohibited.</p>
	<p>By posting content to CITYSLICKING, you warrant and represent that you either own or otherwise control all of the rights to that content, including, without limitation, all the rights necessary for you to provide, post, upload, input or submit the content, or that your use of the content is a protected fair use. You agree that you will not knowingly or with intent to defraud provide material and misleading false information. You represent and warrant also that the content you supply does not violate these Terms, and that you will indemnify and hold CITYSLICKING harmless for any and all claims resulting from content you supply.</p>
	<p>You acknowledge that CITYSLICKING has the right to remove in its sole discretion any content that it considers to violate these Terms or any other CITYSLICKING terms or agreements that may govern your posting on CITYSLICKING’s networks.</p>

	<h2>Blogger Code of Conduct</h2>
	<p>To guide you, CITYSLICKING offers the following Blogger Code of Conduct.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Strive to be authentic and honest in all of your communications so our community knows that you say what you mean forthrightly, and mean what you say.</li>
		<li>Disclose who you are, who you work for and any other relevant affiliations.</li>
		<li>Clarify which posts or comments are your own opinions versus an official corporate statement.</li>
		<li>Be responsible for what you write. Remember that just because you “can” say something doesn’t mean that you should. Publish as fact only that which you believe to be true. If your statement is speculation, say so. If you have reason to believe that something is not true, either don’t post it, or note your reservations. When you make an assertion, do so in good faith; state it as fact only if, to the best of your knowledge, it is so.</li>
		<li>If material exists online, link to online references and original source materials directly.</li>
		<li>Respect copyright, fair use, disclosure laws and other intellectual property rights.</li>
		<li>Be respectful to your company, CITYSLICKING, members, employees, clients, customers, partners and competitors. Disagree with others’ opinions respectfully.</li>
		<li>Respect your audience – Don’t use ethnic slurs, personal insults, obscenity, or other objectionable language. Show proper consideration for their privacy and for topics that may be considered objectionable or inflammatory.</li>
		<li>Don’t cite or reference members, clients, partners, suppliers or others without their prior agreement and approval.</li>
		<li>Write each entry as if it could not be changed; you can add to, but do not rewrite any entry.</li>
		<li>Acknowledge and correct mistakes promptly. Use notations to show where you have made changes so as to maintain the integrity of your original post.</li>
		<li>Respect your employer’s and CITYSLICKING’s confidential and proprietary information. Understand and honor when your company or CITYSLICKING asks that topics not be discussed for confidentiality or legal compliance reasons.</li>
		<li>Disclose any conflict of interest, affiliations, activities and personal agendas.</li>
	</ul>
